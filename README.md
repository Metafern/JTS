## Special Thanks
Special thanks to Yannik Marchand's (and others') Contributions to the [Wiki](https://github.com/kinnay/NintendoClients/wiki) on Nintendo Protocols. Without their documentation this project would have been much, much more difficult.

Also, a shoutout to [Slashcash](https://github.com/Slashcash) who worked on a very similar [project](https://github.com/Slashcash/PSD)
